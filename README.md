# VaccO - The ADVANCE vaccine ontology

This repository will host the public code of the VaccO ontology, which still has to go through licensing and cleaning (4 Jan 2018).

The VaccO ontology web applications are available at <https://euadr.erasmusmc.nl/VaccO>.

The OWL2 files of the VaccO ontology as used in the manuscript "Alignment of vaccine codes using the ADVANCE VaccO ontology" are available as a release <https://github.com/benozol/vacco/releases/tag/manuscript>.
